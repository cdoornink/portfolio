      <div class="description-body">
        <p>I work on the signed-in web application for Napster subscribers, coordinating with a team on a large scale, heavy traffic website in an agile environment.</p>
        <p>When I started the app was a Rails app. Since then we have done several ground-up rebuilds of the our app using the Ember Javascript framework.</p>

      <div class='sub-header'>Family meal planning and shopping list</div>
      <div class="description-header">December 2015</div>
      <div class="description-body">
        <p>I developed this purely for my wife and myself to use. It has all the recipes that we have collected other sources, normalized and simplified for ease of use. When making a meal plan for the week, we simply add the meals we want and the appropriate ingredients are added to the shopping list, organized by aisle. Other items can easily be added to the shopping list and everything stays in sync no matter who is adding things.</p>
        <p>This is an Ember app integrated with Firebase. Many friends have asked if I can make it available for their use which would require a lot of changes and added authentication features which I might eventually when I have the time.</p>

      <div class="description-header">2014</div>
      <div class="description-body">
        <p>This app allows a user to easily record the stats of both teams of a basketball game including shot charts, box scores, and detailed play by play. These stats are then compiled to give detailed team and player stats, as well as advanced analytics such as player efficiency and true shooting percentage.</p>
        <p>This is an Ember app integrated with Firebase. It is pretty much complete minus some bugs and advanced features. I also haven't made any attempt to get people to use it, but really its a pretty great app.</p>

        <p>This was another personal project that I just did for fun. I wanted to see what kind of data was availble on the Fitbit API and how easy it would be to hook up to.</p>

      <div class="description-body">
        <p>I wanted to see how well a game could perform if it is built and rendered entirely with javascript and css.</p>
        <p>Turns out the answer is pretty well. I've been able to put over 200 animated characters moving on screen without any hiccups.</p>
        <p>The game is far from finished, but the first stage is at least playable. I am also collaborating with a designer to get it looking like it does in first screenshot when we both have time...</p>
